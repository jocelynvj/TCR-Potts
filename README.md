# Learning binding avidity landscapes of T-cell receptors

A diverse repertoire of surface receptors on T-cells allows the adaptive immune system to detect a wide range of pathogens and initiate an immune response. The ability of these receptors to bind self or pathogenic epitopes is heavily influenced by the CDR3 region residing within the $\beta$ chain of the receptor. Identifying common patterns in these sequences may therefore give insight into the challenge of predicting epitope specificity. In this project, we infer an independent-site Potts model to describe sequences specific to the YLQPRTFLL and GILGFVTLL epitopes. Furthermore, we investigated the impacts of clustering these sequences to establish multiple localised models, alongside fine-tuning pseudocounts to enhance prediction accuracy.
